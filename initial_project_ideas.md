Users would be able to input individual stock tickers to access realtime price data. In addition, users would have the ability to build a portfolio of securities to be tracked in real time. Historical price data would be stored in a Postgres database and displayed via various charts on the webpage.

## Automated Resume Writer and Job Application Tool
